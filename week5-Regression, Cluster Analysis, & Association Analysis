Question 1

1. Question 1

What is the main difference between classification and regression?



There is no difference since you're predicting a numeric value from the input variables in both tasks.



In classification, you're predicting a category, and in regression, you're predicting a number.

Correct 

That's correct!



In classification, you're predicting a categorical variable, and in regression, you're predicting a nominal variable.



In classification, you're predicting a number, and in regression, you're predicting a category.

Question 2

2. Question 2

Which of the following is NOT an example of regression?



Predicting the demand for a product



Predicting the price of a stock



Determining whether power usage will rise or fall

3. Question 3

In linear regression, the least squares method is used to



Determine the regression line that best fits the samples.

Correct 

That's correct!



Determine the distance between two pairs of samples.



Determine whether the target is categorical or numerical.



Determine how to partition the data into training and test sets.

Question 4

4. Question 4

How does simple linear regression differ from multiple linear regression?



In simple linear regression, the input has only categorical variables. In multiple linear regression, the input has only numerical variables.



In simple linear regression, the input has only categorical variables. In multiple linear regression, the input can be a mix of categorical and numerical variables.



In simple linear regression, the input has only one variable. In multiple linear regression, the input has more than one variables.

Correct 

That's correct!



They are the just different terms for linear regression with one input variable.

Question 5

5. Question 5

The goal of cluster analysis is



To segment data so that differences between samples in the same cluster are maximized and differences between samples of different clusters are minimized.



To segment data so that all samples are evenly divided among the clusters.



To segment data so that all categorical variables are in one cluster, and all numerical variables are in another cluster.



To segment data so that differences between samples in the same cluster are minimized and differences between samples of different clusters are maximized.

Correct 

That's correct!

Question 6

6. Question 6

Cluster results can be used to



All of these choices are valid uses of the resulting clusters.

Correct 

That's correct!



Determine anomalous samples



Segment the data into groups so that each group can be analyzed further 



Classify new samples



Create labeled samples for a classification task

Question 7
Correct1 / 1 points
7. Question 7

A cluster centroid is



The mean of all the samples in the two closest clusters.



The mean of all the samples in the cluster

Correct 

That's correct!



The mean of all the samples in all clusters



The mean of all the samples in the two farthest clusters.

Question 8
Correct1 / 1 points
8. Question 8

The main steps in the k-means clustering algorithm are



Calculate the centroids, then determine the appropriate stopping criterion depending on the number of centroids.



Calculate the distances between the cluster centroids, then find the two closest centroids.



Assign each sample to the closest centroid, then calculate the new centroid.

Correct 

That's correct!



Count the number of samples, then determine the initial centroids.

Question 9
Correct1 / 1 points
9. Question 9

The goal of association analysis is



To find the number of clusters for cluster analysis



To find the most complex rules to explain associations between as many items as possible in the data.



To find rules to capture associations between items or events

Correct 

That's correct!



To find the number of outliers in the data

Question 10
Correct1 / 1 points
10. Question 10

In association analysis, an item set is



A set of items that infrequently occur together



A set of transactions that occur a certain number of times in the data



A set of items that two rules have in common



A transaction or set of items that occur together

Correct 

That's correct!

Question 11
Correct1 / 1 points
11. Question 11

The support of an item set



Captures the number of items in that item set



Captures how many times that item set is used in a rule



Captures the correlation between the items in that item set



Captures the frequency of that item set

Correct 

That's correct!

Question 12
Correct1 / 1 points
